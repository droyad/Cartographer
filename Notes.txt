- allow non-default constructors
- add support for pre-caching mappings
- add support for mapping A --> B where B has .ctor that takes A as argument.
- add an extension point to approve or reject mappings that weren't pre-cached (to ensure all mappings are precached, or almost all to allow for extensibility mapping scenarios etc)
- add support for asynchronous multistep pre-caching (low priority)
- add ability to provide configuration values
- add ability to map meta-types (collections, Lazy<T> etc) as root level-types. That is a mandatory feature
- add ability to log the mapping path so that it can be inspected for errors
- add ability to map into interfaces (w/o providing implementation)
- add ability to build converters chains so that multiple converters gets applied to single mapping step
- be mindful of existing API for conversion and play nice with it when possible. Example IValueConverter for WPF, TypeDescriptor, Convert class etc
