- allow non-default constructors
- add support for pre-caching mappings
- add an extension point to approve or reject mappings that weren't pre-cached (to ensure all mappings are precached, or almost all to allow for extensibility mapping scenarios etc)
- add support for asynchronous multistep pre-caching (low priority)
- add ability to provide configuration parameters to mappers
- add ability to provide configuration values
- add ability to map meta-types (collections, Lazy<T> etc) as root level-types
- add ability to log the mapping path so that it can be inspected for errors
- add ability to map into a pre-existing object [done for top level objects. Not sure doing it recursively is a good idea]
- add ability to map into interfaces (w/o providing implementation)
- support mapping from multiple properties like this: dto.FooIdentifier = new Identifier(item.Foo.Id, item.Foo.ModifiedDate);
- add ability to build converters chains so that multiple converters gets applied to single mapping step
